 -Easy to understand and interactable UI 
 
  Big labeled  buttons  and a detailed tree view + the ability to display images.
 

### Installation

I've provided a ready to go database to use for the testing ( and a directory full of images , i do not own any of the jewlery and don't claim to use it for any financial operation , the images serve as a prop ), import it into MySQL Workbench as the name of richesseDB
and don't forget to change the database's connection credentials !
